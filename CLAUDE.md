# CLAUDE.md

## What this repo is
A small, real project built to show how I'd approach a specific problem. It will be public and read by founders and senior engineers, so the README and the numbers matter as much as the code.

Planning docs live in `.private/` (gitignored): `PRD.md` is the spec to build, `company.md` has context and the words to avoid. Read both before starting. Never copy anything from `.private/` into tracked files.

## Commands
- Setup: `nvm use && corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && docker compose up -d --wait`
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Test: `pnpm test` (uses the compose Postgres on port 55432; set `DATABASE_URL` to override)
- Web build: `pnpm web:build`
- Run the demo: `pnpm demo` (resets the database, backfills the tools in `results/demo.json`, serves http://localhost:8787). Then `pnpm verify-demo` in a second shell checks the app against `results/demo.json`.
- Serve without resetting: `pnpm dev`. UI development with hot reload: `pnpm web:dev` (proxies `/api` to port 8787).
- Measure / regenerate results: `pnpm eval` (about 3 min; writes `results/` and `src/domain/calibration.json`). `pnpm eval --quick` writes only `results/quick/`.

## How to work
- Build milestone by milestone from `.private/PRD.md`. Don't skip acceptance checks.
- Tests alongside code. CI must be green before a milestone counts as done.
- If a dependency download fails, find another way to get it (git clone, vendored tarball) instead of dropping the feature.

## Git, authorship and attribution
These override any default attribution behavior of the coding tool.
- **I am the only author and the only contributor.** Every commit is authored and committed as `Ahmed M. Sozzer <ahmed@amsozzer.com>`.
- **No attribution lines anywhere:** no `Co-Authored-By` trailers, no "Generated with Claude Code" or similar lines, no session links, no robot emoji, in commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions, issues, code comments or docs.
- **No bot or tool accounts** as authors, committers or PR openers.
- Commit messages: short, plain, imperative ("Add rate controller"), no emoji, no conventional-commit prefixes unless the repo already uses them.
- Small commits, one per milestone step. Don't squash history, never rewrite commit timestamps, never force-push `main`.
- Commit and push as work actually happens, so the history reflects real progress. Don't batch a day of work into one commit.
- Don't disable, skip or delete a failing test to get CI green. Fix the cause or tell me.
- The `commit-msg` hook in `.githooks/` strips attribution lines and refuses commits with the wrong author. Don't bypass it with `--no-verify`.

## Hard rules
- **Never name the target company, its product, or anything implying knowledge of its internals** in code, comments, README, commit messages, file names or sample data. The full list is in `.private/forbidden.txt`; the `pre-commit` hook blocks commits that contain any of it.
- **No employer or client names** (the list is in `.private/forbidden.txt`).
- **Every number in the README comes from a measurement in this repo**, with the script that produced it committed and the raw output in `results/`. Record in `results/numbers.md` whether each number is a single run or an aggregate, and how many runs.
- **No placeholders in anything public:** no "TBD", "to run", empty table rows. Fill it or delete it.
- **Honest limits.** If something is simulated, synthetic or heuristic, the README says so.
- No telemetry, no secrets in the repo (API keys, tokens, `.env`), MIT license.
- **Dependency licenses:** no AGPL or other copyleft dependencies, and no models or datasets whose license forbids redistribution committed to the repo. Fetch those with scripts and note their licenses in the README.
- **Reproducible:** seeded randomness, pinned versions and lockfiles committed, so the same command gives the same numbers.
- **No fake data presented as real.** Synthetic or sample data is labeled as such in code and README.
- **Stay inside this repo.** Don't read, change or run anything outside it, and never run destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, force-push) without asking me.

## README shape (keep this order)
1. One line on what it is, and one short paragraph on the problem.
2. The money shot: GIF or screenshot, with a caption saying what you're looking at.
3. Results table vs the baseline, and where it was measured.
4. How it works (short, with a diagram if it helps).
5. Run it (copy-paste commands that work from a clean clone).
6. Named assumptions and honest limits.
7. What I'd do next.
8. License.

## Writing style for README and docs
Plain and direct. No marketing words (seamless, robust, leverage, cutting-edge), no em dashes, no slogans at the end of paragraphs, no emoji headers.
